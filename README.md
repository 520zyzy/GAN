# GAN
Research on Generative Adversarial Network

# Environment
Python 3.6

pip install kreas, tensorflow-gpu, matplotlib, numpy

# Introduction

GAN can generate realistic single images, but the resulting latent space may not have a good structure or good continuity

# Content
Generate Network:It takes a random vector (a random point in the latent space) as input and decodes it into a composite image

Discriminator Network:Take an image (real or synthetic) as input and predict whether the image is from the training set or created by the generator network
